# S100Lint
This is a variation on the UNIX Lint program. This S100Lint program analyses S1xxx XML Schema's and 
validates them with the specified Feature Catalogue. As a second option it is possible to have it
cross reference two specified XML Schema's and scans them for commonalities. If it finds one it 
checks the specified XML if they are similar. Any change gets reported.
