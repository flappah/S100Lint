Versions:
0.1 - 2020/01/15 - First release
0.2 - 2020/01/30 - Added cross checking with feature catalogue. It checks if types defined in the feature catalogue
                   also exist in the specified XML Schema.
0.21- 2020/02/20 - Added strict (--s) option that omits certain checks that usually are more warning than errors. In this case
                   this is primarily added for the "Type" check that checks if a certain simple- or complextype exists with 
                   "Type" added to it. This whilst the feature catalogue has it defined without "Type" added to it.
